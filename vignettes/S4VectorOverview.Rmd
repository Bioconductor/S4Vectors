# Introduction

The
[*S4Vectors*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html)
package provides a framework for representing vector-like and list-like
objects as S4 objects. It defines two central virtual classes, *Vector*
and *List*, and a set of generic functions that extend the semantic of
ordinary vectors and lists in *R*. Package developers can easily
implement vector-like or list-like objects as *Vector* and/or *List*
derivatives. A few low-level *Vector* and *List* derivatives are
implemented in the [*S4Vectors*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html) package itself e.g. *Hits*, *Rle*, and
*DataFrame*). Many more are implemented in the [*IRanges*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IRanges.html) and
[*GenomicRanges*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html) infrastructure packages, and in many other Bioconductor
packages.

In this vignette, we will rely on simple, illustrative example datasets,
rather than large, real-world data, so that each data structure and
algorithm can be explained in an intuitive, graphical manner. We expect
that packages that apply
[*S4Vectors*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html)
to a particular problem domain will provide vignettes with relevant,
realistic examples.

The
[*S4Vectors*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html)
package is available at bioconductor.org and can be downloaded via
`BiocManager::install`:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager")) 
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("S4Vectors") 
library(S4Vectors)
```

# Vector-like and list-like objects

In the context of the
[*S4Vectors*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html)
package, a vector-like object is an ordered finite collection of
elements. All vector-like objects have three main properties: (1) a
notion of length or number of elements, (2) the ability to extract
elements to create new vector-like objects, and (3) the ability to be
concatenated with one or more vector-like objects to form larger
vector-like objects. The main functions for these three operations are
`length`, `[`, and `c`. Supporting these operations provide a great deal
of power and many vector-like object manipulations can be constructed
using them.

Some vector-like objects can also have a list-like semantic, which means
that individual elements can be extracted with `[[`.

In
[*S4Vectors*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html)
and many other Bioconductor packages, vector-like and list-like objects
derive from the *Vector* and *List* virtual classes, respectively. Note
that *List* is a subclass of *Vector*.

The following subsections describe each in turn.

## Vector-like objects

As a first example of vector-like objects, we'll look at *Rle* objects.
In *R*, atomic sequences are typically stored in atomic vectors. But
there are times when these object become too large to manage in memory.
When there are lots of consecutive repeats in the sequence, the data can
be compressed and managed in memory through a run-length encoding where
a data value is paired with a run length. For example, the sequence {1,
1, 1, 2, 3, 3} can be represented as values = {1, 2, 3}, run lengths =
{3, 1, 2}.

The *Rle* class defined in the
[*S4Vectors*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html)
package is used to represent a run-length encoded (compressed) sequence
of *logical*, *integer*, *numeric*, *complex*, *character*, *raw*, or
*factor* values. Note that the *Rle* class extends the *Vector* virtual
class:

```{r Rle-extends-Vector}
showClass("Rle")
```

One way to construct *Rle* objects is through the *Rle* constructor
function:

```{r initialize}
set.seed(0)
lambda <- c(rep(0.001, 4500), seq(0.001, 10, length=500),
            seq(10, 0.001, length=500))
xVector <- rpois(1e7, lambda)
yVector <- rpois(1e7, lambda[c(251:length(lambda), 1:250)])
xRle <- Rle(xVector)
yRle <- Rle(yVector)
```

*Rle* objects are vector-like objects:

```{r basic-ops}
length(xRle)
xRle[1]
zRle <- c(xRle, yRle)
```

### Subsetting a vector-like object

As with ordinary *R* atomic vectors, it is often necessary to subset one
sequence from another. When this subsetting does not duplicate or
reorder the elements being extracted, the result is called a
*subsequence*. In general, the `[` function can be used to construct a
new sequence or extract a subsequence, but its interface is often
inconvenient and not amenable to optimization. To compensate for this,
the
[*S4Vectors*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html)
package supports seven additional functions for sequence extraction:

1.`window` - Extracts a subsequence over a specified region.

2.`subset` - Extracts the subsequence specified by a logical vector.

3.`head` - Extracts a consecutive subsequence containing the first n
elements.

4.`tail` - Extracts a consecutive subsequence containing the last n
elements.

5.`rev` - Creates a new sequence with the elements in the reverse order.

6.`rep` - Creates a new sequence by repeating sequence elements.

The following code illustrates how these functions are used on an *Rle*
vector:

```{r seq-extraction}
xSnippet <- window(xRle, 4751, 4760)
xSnippet
```

```{r}
head(xSnippet)
```

```{r}
tail(xSnippet)
```

```{r}
rev(xSnippet)
```

```{r}
rep(xSnippet, 2)
```

```{r}
subset(xSnippet, xSnippet >= 5L)
```

### Concatenating vector-like objects

The
[*S4Vectors*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html)
package uses two generic functions, `c` and `append`, for concatenating
two *Vector* derivatives. The methods for *Vector* objects follow the
definition that these two functions are given the
[*base*](http://bioconductor.org/about/removed-packages/) package.

```{r seq-concatenate}
c(xSnippet, rev(xSnippet))
```

```{r}
append(xSnippet, xSnippet, after=3)
```

### Looping over subsequences of vector-like objects

In *R*, \Rfunction{for} looping can be an expensive operation. To
compensate for this,
the [*S4Vectors*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html)
package provides `aggregate` and `shiftApply` methods (`shiftApply` is a
new generic function defined in
[*S4Vectors*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html))
to perform calculations over subsequences of vector-like objects.

The `aggregate` function combines sequence extraction functionality of
the `window` function with looping capabilities of the `sapply`
function. For example, here is some code to compute medians across a
moving window of width 3 using the function `aggregate`:

```{r aggregate}
xSnippet
```

```{r}
aggregate(xSnippet, start=1:8, width=3, FUN=median)
```

The `shiftApply` function is a looping operation involving two
vector-like objects whose elements are lined up via a positional shift
operation. For example, the elements of `xRle` and `yRle` were simulated
from Poisson distributions with the mean of element i from `yRle` being
equivalent to the mean of element i + 250 from `xRle`. If we did not
know the size of the shift, we could estimate it by finding the shift
that maximizes the correlation between `xRle` and `yRle`.

```{r shiftApply-cor}
cor(xRle, yRle)
```

```{r}
shifts <- seq(235, 265, by=3)
corrs  <- shiftApply(shifts, yRle, xRle, FUN=cor)
```

```{r figshiftcorrs, fig=TRUE, eps=FALSE, width=5,fig.align = 'center', height=5, fig.cap='Correlation between `xRle` and `yRle` for various shifts'}
plot(shifts, corrs)
```
The result is shown in Fig.\@ref(fig:figshiftcorrs)

### More on *Rle* objects

When there are lots of consecutive repeats, the memory savings through
an RLE can be quite dramatic. For example, the `xRle` object occupies
less than one third of the space of the original `xVector` object, while
storing the same information:

```{r Rle-vector-compare}
as.vector(object.size(xRle) / object.size(xVector))
identical(as.vector(xRle), xVector)
```

The functions `runValue` and `runLength` extract the run values and run
lengths from an *Rle* object respectively:

```{r Rle-accessors}
head(runValue(xRle))
head(runLength(xRle))
```

The *Rle* class supports many of the basic methods associated with *R*
atomic vectors including the Ops, Math, Math2, Summary, and Complex
group generics. Here is a example of manipulating *Rle* objects using
methods from the Ops group:

```{r Rle-ops}
xRle > 0
xRle + yRle
xRle > 0 | yRle > 0
```

Here are some from the Summary group:

```{r Rle-summary}
range(xRle)
sum(xRle > 0 | yRle > 0)
```

And here is one from the Math group:

```{r Rle-math}
log1p(xRle)
```

As with atomic vectors, the `cor` and `shiftApply` functions operate on
*Rle* objects:

```{r Rle-cor}
cor(xRle, yRle)
shiftApply(249:251, yRle, xRle,
           FUN=function(x, y) {var(x, y) / (sd(x) * sd(y))})
```

For more information on the methods supported by the *Rle* class,
consult the `Rle` man page.

## List-like objects

Just as with ordinary *R* *List* objects, *List*-derived objects support
`[[` for element extraction, `c` for concatenating, and
`lapply`/`sapply` for looping. `lapply` and `sapply` are familiar to
many *R* users since they are the standard functions for looping over
the elements of an *R* *list* object.

In addition, the
[*S4Vectors*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html)
package introduces the `endoapply` function to perform an endomorphism
equivalent to `lapply`, i.e. it returns a *List* derivative of the same
class as the input rather than a *list* object.

An example of *List* derivative is the *DataFrame* class:

```{r DataFrame-extends-List}
showClass("DataFrame")
```

One way to construct *DataFrame* objects is through the *DataFrame*
constructor function:

```{r DataFrame, warning=FALSE}
df <- DataFrame(x=xRle, y=yRle)
sapply(df, class)
sapply(df, summary)
sapply(as.data.frame(df), summary)
endoapply(df, `+`, 0.5)
```

For more information on *DataFrame* objects, consult the *DataFrame* man
page.

[*IRanges*](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IRanges.html)
package'' vignette in the

package for many more examples of *List* derivatives.

# DataFrame and DataFrameList objects

TODO

# Vector Annotations

Often when one has a collection of objects, there is a need to attach
metadata that describes the collection in some way. Two kinds of
metadata can be attached to a *Vector* object:

1.  Metadata about the object as a whole: this metadata is accessed via
    the `metadata` accessor and is represented as an ordinary *list*;
2.  Metadata about the individual elements of the object: this metadata
    is accessed via the `mcols` accessor (`mcols` stands for *metadata
    columns*) and is represented as a *DataFrame* object.This
    *DataFrame* object can be thought of as the result of binding
    together one or several vector-like objects (the metadata columns)
    of the same length as the *Vector* object. Each row of the
    *DataFrame* object annotates the corresponding element of the
    *Vector* object.
